Navigate to the repo root and run:
`
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 --system-site-packages svaksvat_ve
`
Activate the virtualenv
- Linux/Mac: `source svaksvat_ve/bin/activate`
- Windows: `svaksvat_ve/Scripts/activate`

`pip install -I -r requirements.txt`

Running with Vagrant
====================

Vagrant brings up a virtual machine, that hosts the database and maybe ldap in
the future. It is meant to make starting development easier.

You can install vagrant from http://vagrantup.com

You'll also need VirtualBox to manage the virtual machines http://virtualbox.org

Navigate to the repo root with the Vagrantfile and run:
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-librarian-chef
vagrant up
```

Now is a good time to fetch a coffee. After the 'vagrant up' command finishes
you can run SvakSvat with the following commands:

```
cp svaksvat.cfg.vagrant svaksvat.cfg
python3 svaksvatgui.py
```

Enter `members` as username and password everywhere

To run svaksvat scripts:
ex.
`
python3 scripts/modulenadresser.py
`
